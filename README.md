A Brazilian researcher interested in patterns of biodiversity distribution in time and space, focusing on the impacts of global change (climate change and land-use and land-cover change). I like open science, good workflows, and reproducibility to make science. My recent interests and work include 1. Analysis of climate data and land-use and land-cover data under different scenarios of climate change, 2. Biodiversity, 3. Spatial analysis (GIS), 4. Bioinformatics, R programming language, Google Earth Engine, etc.
