### Hi there I'm Tain√° :octocat:


A Brazilian researcher and data scientist working on patterns of biodiversity, focusing on the impacts of global change (climate change and land-use and land-cover change). My recent interests and work include 1. Analysis of climate data and land-use and land-cover data under different scenarios of climate change, 2. Biodiversity, 3. Predictive models of species niche and potential distribution, 4. Spatial analysis (GIS), 5. Bioinformatics, R programming language, Google Earth Engine etc.

I use open-source tools and platforms. I am interested in good practices in open science (open databases, open software), good workflows, reproducibility, and FAIR principles.
